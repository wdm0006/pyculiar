    Seasonal-Trend decomposition procedure based on LOESS

    data : pandas.Series

    ns : int
        Length of the seasonal smoother.
        The value of  ns should be an odd integer greater than or equal to 3.
        A value ns>6 is recommended. As ns  increases  the  values  of  the
        seasonal component at a given point in the seasonal cycle (e.g., January
        values of a monthly series with  a  yearly cycle) become smoother.

    period : int
        Period of the seasonal component.
        For example, if  the  time series is monthly with a yearly cycle, then
        period=12.
        If no value is given, then the period will be determined from the
        ``data`` timeseries.
